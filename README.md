## Install

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not try to fix or change the device fingerprint after using this TWRP.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not install this TWRP while Magisk or KernelSU modules are active.

Using a userdebug ABL can make installation easier because it enables fastboot access. The `abl_unlock.elf` file is included in this repository.

To enable fastboot with ZTE Toolbox:

1. Open ZTE Toolbox.
2. Select option `12`.
3. Enter the target ABL partition name: `abl_a` or `abl_b`.
4. Flash the included `abl_unlock.elf` userdebug ABL.
5. Reboot the phone into fastboot:

```shell
adb reboot bootloader
```

You can also flash the recovery image directly with ZTE Toolbox:

1. Select option `12`.
2. Enter the target recovery partition name: `recovery_a` or `recovery_b`.
3. Repeat the same step for the other recovery slot if you want to flash both `recovery_a` and `recovery_b`.

Manual fastboot commands:

```shell
fastboot flash recovery recovery.img
```

or flash both recovery slots:

```shell
fastboot flash recovery_a recovery.img
fastboot flash recovery_b recovery.img
```

For GSI ROM installation, disable verity and verification on the vbmeta partitions from fastboot:

```shell
fastboot --disable-verity flash vbmeta_a vbmeta.img
fastboot --disable-verity flash vbmeta_b vbmeta.img
fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta_system_a vbmeta_system.img
fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta_system_b vbmeta_system.img
```

On the tested NX809J unit, flashing the active recovery slot was enough. No extra vbmeta disable step was required for the tested TWRP recovery image.

If the phone enters a bootloop after installation, open ZTE Toolbox and select option `19`.

## Notes

- Touchscreen was tested on REDMAGIC 11 Pro / NX809J.
- Touch coordinate mapping is fixed for the `synaptics_tcm_touch` panel.
- The touch debug pointer trail is disabled.
- Fastbootd was tested successfully.
- Wi-Fi scanning, WPA2 connection, DHCP, DNS, and network access were tested in TWRP.
- Haptic feedback was tested through the AWINIC driver using the `zte_vibrator` `duration_aw` / `activate_aw` path.
- ADB sideload mode was fixed and tested. The host now detects the device as `sideload` after starting sideload from TWRP.
- Full ZIP sideload installation still needs a harmless test package before marking the complete install flow as fully verified.
- It is not possible to fix the device fingerprint using TWRP.
